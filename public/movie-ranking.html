<h1>Sushmith's Favourite Movies</h1>
<hr/>
<h2>My favourite movies of all time:</h2>

<h3>Three Idiots</h3>
<p>I love this film because it poignantly described my feelings about the Indian education system in which I grew up. It even inspired a short-film I made years later.</p>

<h3>The Ramayana</h3>
<p>The Japanese produced Ramayana film was one I watched every year as a child. Not only does it depict one of my favourite stories beautifully, but it also features melodic original Sanskrit compositions that serenaded my ears and left me brimming with joy!</p>

<h3>RRR</h3>
<p>While this is the film that is most likely to be removed from this list, it was definitely the best movie I watched in 2022. Breathtaking action, stunning visuals, great bromance, and inspirational courage. </p>
